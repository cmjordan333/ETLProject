
Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
Your project must use 2 or more sources of data. We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:
1. Kaggle - csv
2. 14ers - csv
You can also use APIs or data scraped from the web. However, get approval from your instructor first. Again, there is only a week to complete this!

Data Cleanup & Analysis
1. Found/ Merged CSVs
2. Remove special characters from csv
3. Used Pandas Weather API - searches current weather obvervations
4. Used JSON
5. had to remove spaces from table names to run script
6.  transformed the csv by removing hyphens
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:
Data Sources: https://openweathermap.org/current, https://openweathermap.org/current,
DATA (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
Production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
Final Table.
